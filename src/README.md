A simple [RUST](https://www.rust-lang.org/) program to demonstrate the [Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem). 

This was done as an exercise whilst I was learning RUST, so don't expect too much. Of course, if you have any suggestions to improve my code then please flag it as a issue. Suggestions as to idiomatic RUST styles are also very welcome.  

To run use: 

```rust
cargo run 
```

This runs a simulation of 10 000 games. 

To restrict the number of games (for instance to 100) use:

```rust
cargo run 100 
```
